# Warehouse Inventory System

This Java console application serves as a warehouse inventory system designed to store and manage goods. It enables users, akin to warehouse staff, to search for products in a warehouse inventory using the required combination of parameters (e.g., name, ID, color, etc.). The system reads the inventory data from a pre-formatted text file, typically in CSV format, and allows users to search using a command-line interface. During the development process, great emphasis was placed on adhering to sound architectural principles, particularly in breaking down the system into distinct layers:

- Entity Design
- Data Access Layer
- Service Design
- Controller Layer

## Usage

To run the application, simply execute the main method in your IDE or through the command line
